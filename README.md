# devOpps

 
## Description 
  
devOpps is a dynamic web platform created from the collaboration of Sarah Egleston, Jill O'Reilly, Will Mowlam, Richard Llewellyn, and Ramon Saguini de Andrade. devOpps serves as a comprehensive job website tailored specifically for developers, revolutionising the way developers connect with job opportunities and employers.

At its core, devOpps functions as a central hub where developers can explore job listings, create personalised profiles, and apply for positions that align with their skill sets and interests. Through intuitive search functionalities, developers can efficiently navigate through an array of job postings, filtering by criteria such as location, job title and required skills.

Moreover, devOpps caters to the needs of employers by offering a dedicated section where they can browse through developer profiles to identify potential candidates for their open positions. Employers can easily search and filter profiles based on specific criteria.
